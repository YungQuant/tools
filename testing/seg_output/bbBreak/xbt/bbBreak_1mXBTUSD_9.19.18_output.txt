Robert & Taweh,
I appreciate the offer and am excited about the opportunity to work with you to make RiverBlock a huge success. I have shown my enthusiasm and dedication to the work these past few weeks with the work I have contributed without compensation because I believe in the team, the work and in my ability to add value. 

I am currently considering other attractive offers and as you can imagine, do not feel it would be wise to decline concrete offers and dedicate the time and effort I would want to dedicate to RiverBlock, uncompensated and without a long-term commitment. That being said, I am most excited about this opportunity and would love to feature our work at the Google conference next week. My desire is to join the team now, at the proposed capitalization you included. I am happy to discuss expectations and metrics for the first three-months of work, and long-term.

In addition, in order to assume my role as head of trading, I will need unfettered and transparent access to our predictions model. It is crucial for me to understand the logic behind how our trades are being made to oversee and manage them. This would also open up the avenue of my contribution to said predictions model which although may not be my primary role, and will not be my primary focus, could potentially be very advantageous for RiverBlock as a firm. 

I am, and will continue to be, as flexible as reasonably possible and am open to further discussion. I truly desire very few things more than to do this work, with this team specifically. I look forward to hearing back from both of you, thanks again!

Hey guys I appreciate the offer and your terms are generous for sure however I have a couple major hang ups. The primary problem for me is that I cannot, at this point in my career, risk 3 months of undivided attention and work for the ability to maybe join a company that maybe profitable. I make upwards of $1k/hr as a contractual market maker and have been shooting down ongoing offers to do so in favor of uncompensated contribution to RiverBlock. By choice, I may add, because I so desire to do this work with you. 

Right now I am deferring 3 cofounder offers (all of which would have similar equity offerings & one actively profitable w/compensation) from companies in and out of crypto. In addition, 2 market making contract offers (both well over >$1k/hr) in preparation to devote all of my time to RiverBlock. That's off the top of my often forgetful head. I have never, and do not plan to, ever been involved in an unsuccessful startup. From Nonpariel Capital, to CryptoWorks, to Asymmetric Volatility Services, companies I involve myself with are profitable. I'm not just deferring offers, I'm deferring the majority of my waking life. From concerts, to girls, to beers with the boys, I am sacrificing the normal fun life of a successful 20 year old in order to ensure the success of the companies I involve myself with. As head of trading we all know my hours will be the longest and most stressful with the success of the fund, and ongoing operations, being my responsibility.

The traditional way of compensating talent for the extreme risk of taking $0 value equity in a startup as (sole) compensation is via generous equity packages with generous vesting schedules. Your offer is definitely generous in terms of proposed equity sharing but the timeframe, and lack of commitment, is just not tenable for me. Given a minimal (obv very minimal) 3 hours of work per day you are asking me to in essence pay $270k just to get an actual offer. I'm going to need a real offer, which we all sign and date as official, detailing something along the lines of 5-10% equity upfront with a following vesting schedule (for 15-25% equity) not to exceed 4 years. This will enable me to continue my work not just on our execution systems but as a representative of RiverBlock in order to assist with our funding initiative, accruement of talent, and other social capital.

In addition, in order to assume my role as head of trading, I will need unfettered and transparent access to our predictions model. It is crucial for me to understand the logic behind how our trades are being made to oversee and manage them. This would also open up the avenue of my contribution to said predictions model which although may not be my primary role, and will not be my primary focus, could potentially be very advantageous for RiverBlock as a firm. 

I am, and will continue to be, trying to be as flexible as reasonably possible. I truly desire very few things more than to do this work with this team specifically, hence my pro bono contributions and offers, but we must do so in a way that everybody's incentives are aligned to RiverBlock's success. I look forward to hearing back from both of you, thanks again!
